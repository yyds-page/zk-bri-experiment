## Introduction
This is an implementation of [the paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1247), which build a GKR-based interactive proof for unlayered circuit. In terms of the polynomial commitment to achieve succinctness, we support [virgo](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1482). We test our protocol with SHA circuits.

## Requirement
- C++14

## Run
``` bash
./run.sh
```
